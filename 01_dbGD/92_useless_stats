	Hello everyone and welcome to the 1992 edition of useless
	trivia!! The following information was gathered from set
	lists posted to this newsgroup as well as from listening
	to tapes from 1992.  Every set list was cross-referenced to
	at least two different sources, and we believe them to be
	correct.

	Please e-mail corrections to the following address, DO NOT
	post them. We will post a set of corrections at some point
	in the future. The address is:

		raj@ctt.bellcore.com    and/or
		simon@xtal0.harvard.edu

	This year's addition contains several new features, including
	a summary of every year from 1974-1992, and a summary of the
	songs played in the 1990's so far.  If you have an idea for 
	additional Useless DeadStats, please email your idea to ejs.

	This information may be freely copied BUT please do not 
	use it for personal gain.


	Enjoy!!

 Show By Show Analysis
 ---------------------

For each show, every song is listed by how many times it was played
        that year.  Drums and Space are not counted in this manner.
        For each set and show, the 'average occurrence' of the songs
        in that set/show for the year is listed.  This is intended to
        give a comparison of the 'uniqueness' of shows.  At the end
        of the list, the most and least unique sets and shows
        are listed.
Furthermore, the number of songs seen for the first and last time
        is listed after each show, as well as songs that returned after
        a significant hiatus.
