I thought the show was very hot tonight. I found it much more fun than Monday's show... The whole first set really rocked with the band and the crowd really 
into it. However, it was a bit disappointing that they only played 6 songs in 
the set. The set was about 50 minutes, and another song or two would have been 
very appropriate.  I liked Vince's song quite a bit. This was the first time 
that I heard it, and I was very impressed. Anyway, it was a good time for one 
and all!

The band seemed to be much more together and tight tonight. Jerry still has it 
after all!
