Since I see that setlists have already been posted, I just wanted to make a 
few comments on the two new songs.  Jerry's new song "So Many Roads to Ease my
Soul" didn't do too much for me.  It's nice, sort of reminescent of "Standing
on the Moon", has some nice lyrics, but isn't anything major.
Personally, I was blown away by Phil's new "Wave to the Wind".  It's unlike
any other Dead song.  If I had to make comparisons, I would say that it is
sort of in the same vain as "Unbroken Chain", but with a much "bigger" sound.
It sounds to me that there is a LOT they can do with this number, and last nite
only barely scratched the surface of this one.  Near the end of "Wave to the
Wind", they opened it up a little in a neat jam.  It's the sort of song that
could be explored for 15-20 minutes without covering the same ground twice.
I'm anxious to see the lyrics to it; I couldn't understand any of it at the 
show.  I've heard some negative comments about "Wave to the Wind", and I
hope that anyone who was there will post their opinions about it.
