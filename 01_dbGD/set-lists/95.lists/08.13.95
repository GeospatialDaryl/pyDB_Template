PARADE
	The parade featured two of the large heads that have appeared at
many of the "holiday" shows at Oakland, dragons, a Dixieland band played on 
a flatbed truck, drummers in a New Orleans funeral procession.  The
procession ened at a little stage above a shrine for Jerry.  People
that initially went on the stage included members of the band,
Babatunde Olatunji, Paul Kantner, Zakir Hussain, Pete and Sheila
Escovedo...  

CEREMONY speakers in order (Everything was interpreted in sign
language for hearing impaired):

Babatunde Olatunji
   (Incantation:  call and response with crowd.)  "This world is without 
end.  And so was the life of our friend and our brother, Jerry Garcia.  
(More call and response with crowd, in Olatunji's native language:  Ah-ye, 
ah-ye Jerry Garcia long (?).  In this world without end, ah-ye, ah-ye.)  The 
celebration of the spirit of a-jah-jah, say a-jah-jah (crowd responds).  Eh-
mi-lu (crowd responds).  The I am that I am, he has become one of the 
great spirits, the only spirit that you and I shall become.  The one spirit 
that rules the whole universe.  More call and response with crowd:  Ah-ye, 
ah-ye , Jerry Garcia long.  Oh, long.  Ah-ye, ah-ye.  Ah-ye, ah-ye.  (More in 
his native language -- I couldn't even attempt to spell it!)  Oh ya.
   "Thank you all, thank you all for being here.  We are celebrating 
ourselves.  We are celebrating the great spirit of our brother and our 
friend.  Yes, please remember that he has played his role, his part.  The 
rest is left to you and I.  Remember his contribution to make our lives 
much richer, happier and beautiful.  Please, I am very honored to 
introduce to you a very wonderful lady.  His wife, Deborah."

Deborah Koons Garcia:
   "What a great guy Jerry was!  He would have loved this, he is loving it.  
He was a big-hearted, generous, wonderful, hard working man.  I want 
everyone to know that he died in his sleep with a smile on his face.  He 
was working hard to purify himself and we thought it was gonna be for a 
good long life, but it was for another journey.  But he loved his life, he 
loved ALL of you.  And what I learned from Jerry was to open my heart 
and live fully in the moment.  And for that, and for everything else, and 
for all the beauty in his life, I want to say thank you, Jerry, I love you."

Annabelle Garcia:
   "I know that he's watchin' us all.  And my Dad always told me that if it 
weren't for you guys there was no way it could've lasted the way that it 
did.  And I want each and everybody here to know that even though he's 
gone, every single one of us has to keep it going.  And if that means by 
being kind to someone we don't particularly care for, and if that means 
being kind to a cop who's givin' us a hard time, and if that means making 
sure that you're kind to your children and to your children's children, and 
to their children.  You gotta make sure above all that you're kind to our 
Earth that we belong to and that gave him life and gave me life and gave 
each one of us life.  And there's no way that this could happen in any 
other country in the world than America.  And I want you all to remember 
that we are Americans and my father was one of the greatest Americans 
that was ever born.  And I also want you to know, on behalf of my other 
sisters, we love each and every one of you guys -- y'all put us through 
college!  And made it so we didn't have to work in Dairy Queen.  And 
we're gonna keep the faith for as long as we can.  And I want you guys to 
respect each other and love each other.  And think to yourself when 
something's wrong:  what would Jerry do?  And keep it up, you know?  
You gotta keep together.  And be grateful."

Wavy Gravy:
   "Two words I got from Charles Schulz and "Peanuts":  Good Grief!  We 
are havin' some good grief today.  John Luis Borge (sp.?) says every time 
you say a line of William Shakespeare you become William Shakespeare at 
that moment.  Well I've been asked to speak for Robert Hunter, so Bob, 
like the Dalai Lama says, all I can do is my best.  This is an elegy for Jerry.

"Jerry, my friend,
you've done it again,
even in your silence 
the familiar pressure
comes to bear, demanding
I pull words from the air
with only this morning
and part of the afternoon
to compose an ode worthy
of one so particular
about every turn of phrase,
demanding it hit home 
in a thousand ways
before making it his own,
and this I can't do alone.
Now that the singer is gone,
where shall I go for the song?

"Without your melody and taste
to lend an attitude of grace
a lyric is an orphan thing,
a hive with neither honey's taste
nor power to truly sting.

"What choice have I but to dare and
call your muse who thought to rest
out of the thin blue air
that out of the field of shared time,
a line or two might chance to shine --

"As ever when we called,
in hope if not in words,
the muse descends.

"How should she desert us now?
Scars of battle on her brow,
bedraggled feathers on her wings,
and yet she sings, she sings!

"May she bear thee to thy rest,
the ancient bower of flowers
beyond the solitude of days,
the tyranny of hours--
the wreath of shining laurel lie
upon your shaggy head
bestowing power to play the lyre
to legions of the dead

"If some part of that music
is heard in deepest dream,
or on some breeze of Summer
a snatch of golden theme,
we'll know you live inside us
with love that never parts
our good old Jack O'Diamonds
become the King of Hearts.

"I feel your silent laughter
at sentiments so bold
that dare to step across the line
to tell what must be told,
so I'll just say I love you,
which I never said before
and let it go at that old friend
the rest you may ignore.

   "And then this short one is from me, the old psychedelic relic, Jer.  
We're a double dip.  This is a haiku for Jerry on the day of his demise:

"The fat man rocks out
Hinges fall off Heaven's door
"Come on in," says Bill"

Bob Weir:
   "I don't know where to start, but here I go.  Um, you know, I think I owe 
Jerry an immense debt of gratitude for, you know, showing me how to, 
how to live with joy, with mischief.  And so, what I think I want to do is 
give some of that back to him now, make him complete, make him whole.  
And so, I want to ask you all to join me, not just now, but daily.  Take 
your heart, take your faith, and reflect back some of the joy that he gave 
you.  He filled this world full of clouds of joy.  Just take a little bit of that 
and reflect it back up to him, or wherever he is, just shine it back to him.  
Thanks."

Steve Parrish:
   "You've seen us up here scurryin' around, runnin' around all these 
years.  I wanna just tell you we did it because we loved you, too, all of 
you, you were great.  You're the best people there are.  Thank you.  Thank 
you VERY much."

Mickey Hart:
   "Well, if the Grateful Dead had been anything, it was about, it gave you 
the power.  You have it now.  You have the groove, you have the feeling.  
We've been working on it for almost thirty years now.  So what are you 
going to do with it?  That's the question, okay?  Now you take it to your, 
take your Dead heads, and you take 'em home, and you do something 
with all this.  We didn't do this for nothing, you know.  I mean, so it's not 
over, you see.  That's the thing about music, it's what is the commodity, 
you know, what do you get at the end, you know, beside just the ya-yas 
and a new car and all that.  You get the power and you get the wisdom 
and the insight to deal with the everyday life.  And that's what music is 
all about.  And it'll help you.  It'll help you in these times, it'll help you 
forever.  So.  That's what we were all about.  We shared thousands of 
great grooves, magic moments.  All of us.  You were as much a part of the 
Grateful Dead as anyone.  You made us go on, you know, in the Midwest 
when we were playin' and no one was there and then you started comin' 
and then these more people, and then more.  So this means a lot to all of 
us, and you kept us goin', y'know, and you were the fuel.  You were part 
of it, a big part of it.  You should know that, take that with you.  We all 
love you for that.  Thank you."

Phil Lesh:
   "Jerry was a friend of mine.  He was my brother.  He was a wounded 
warrior.  And now he's done with becoming.  Now he is being.  Jerry, God 
bless you.  Go with God.  I love you.  And he loved you, too.  And WE love 
you.  Keep it comin'."

Bill Kreutzmann:
   "Hello.  For me it is about the highest moment of my life was when the 
band was playin' and cookin', and playin' with Jerry and these guys 
behind me.  That's the best.  There's nothin' higher for me.  I've not found 
it any other way.  So keep it alive, and I love you very much, and thanks 
for your support.  It's amazing."

Paul Kantner:
   "Dudes.  Jerry in his weaker moments used to call me Pauly.  Nobody 
else does that and I'm sorta gonna miss it.  (Crowd shouts "Pauly" at him.)  
Okay, that's it.  I brought a poem along that I read for Bill a while back.  
Some of the words that fit here today, I hope.  It's called "For the Good of 
All".  (I didn't transcribe this poem because it's very long.)

Vince Welnick:
   "Hi there.  The first time I ever lay eyes on Jerry I believed in Santa 
Claus.  And he could be ornery at times, but that was just his body 
talkin', not his soul, because I never ever met a kinder man in the whole 
world.  Everybody's askin' the big question, and love is the answer.  And 
I'll always believe in Santa Claus."

John Barlow:
   "They asked me to come up here and speak a word, and rarely in my 
life have I had so few of them.  And so I'll just speak one:  love."
