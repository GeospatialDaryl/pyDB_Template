The file 1991-in-SOD-format contains the setlist info from Eric Simon's Year
in Review posting. I've imported it into Stack O' Dead 1.8 and verified and
corrected all the info (song titles, etc), and then exported it back out
again, so you should be able to import this file into your copy of SOD without
any major problems (you may have to add a coupla songs tho).
