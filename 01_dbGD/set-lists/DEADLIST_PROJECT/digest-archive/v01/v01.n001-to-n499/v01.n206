Subject: 1994 deadlists

Here is some initial setlist data for 1994.  Most of it came from
the dead-heads mailing list.  I've timed a few shows so far and
have a bunch more to do, but I figured I'd post this now so at
least we have some data for '94.  These are all the official
song titles form Matt's list, except for The Mighty Quinn (Quinn
the Eskimo) and (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction, which have parens in the
title (what do we want to do about songs with parens in the title vs.
parens as the comment delimitter?) and Drums Jam and Space Jam which I
still list as Drums and Space.  Come to think of it, there are 2 other
exceptions:  does anyone know which new Phil song was played before
Deal at 6/9/94, and what was the set 1 closer for 7/20/94?
