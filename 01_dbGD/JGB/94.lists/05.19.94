Sorry to be the one to bring the bad news, but Jerry Garcia walked off the
stage in Phoenix tonight(5-19-94)

After a strong beginning (How Sweet it is, Waitin for a Miracle, Dear
Prudence and others, he walked off the stage and was not up to returning.

I hope everything is OK, as I'm sure you all do, and I',m sure there will
be more on this one.

 I
 How Sweet It Is
 Miracle
 Money Honey
 Dear Prudence
 Sisters & Brothers
 
 After about an hour of set break,  a lot of staff people got on stage and an
 announcementa was made that Jerry had the flu, could not get his strength
 back and that the second set was cancelled.  Jerry looked really bad during
 the first set.  More lyrics forgotten then remembered;  meandering leads --
 sounds like vintage 84 or 85 to me.  I hope it's really the flu.
