Legion Of Mary:  A Catalogue of Gigs, Setlists & Tapes and Repertoire of
Songs & Jams

"Legion of Mary" is the name tape collectors use for a version of the Jerry
Garcia Band which played more than 100 dates between January '74 and July
'75, though it is uncertain for how many of these performances the band was
actually billed as "The Legion of Mary" (LM).  Besides Garcia on lead guitar
and vocals and his stalwart buddy John Kahn on bass, LM featured Merl
Saunders on keyboards and vocals and Martin Fierro on tenor sax and flute.

At least three different drummers played with the Legion during its 18
months of existance:  Paul Humphrey, Ron Tutt and Bill Kreutzmann.
According to DeadBase VII's GarciaBase (DB), Humphrey's tenure extended from
7/12/74 through 1/23/75 and Tutt's from 2/14/75 through 7/4/75; Kreutzmann
was an occasional participant, drumming for LM on 11/5/73, 7/12/74 and
11/9/74, for instance.

The Legion played almost exclusively in small clubs, mostly around the San
Francisco Bay area but also during three brief visits to Southern California
and on two East Coast tours (November '74, April '75).  Keystone Berkeley
11/5/73 was probably the band's first gig and Great American Music Hall, SF
7/4/75 its last.


This document consists of two parts.  The first is a catalogue of LM gigs,
setlists and tapes.  This lists the 112 gigs LM is known to have played
(11/95).  For 41 shows we have only the dates and venues as given without
setlists in DB.  For the remaining 71 shows we have setlists as well, 45
derived from tapes in circulation, the rest from DB.  The best tapes
circulating often correct DB; DB's LM lists should be regarded with due
caution; wherever they are given here (only when no tape circulates) they
are enclosed in < triangular > brackets.

Where tape does circulate the approximate length in minutes (generally
rounded up to the next 45-minute side) and the tape's source (soundboard or
audience, SBD or AUD) are given immediately following the venue and date.
The setlists that follow such entries (90 SBD, 180 AUD, etc) are based on
careful examination of the tapes (often, examination of several copies) and
give the correct sequence of songs for the complete set or show (or as much
of it as the evidence permits).  Where they conflict with DB in my judgment
the evidence shows that they are correct and DB mistaken.

After this there appears a repertoire of LM songs and instrumental jams.  It
contains two sections, the first a catalogue listing the 39 songs certainly
or probably included in LM's repertoire, each followed by a listing of the
date of every known performance, the second a catalogue treating LM's 13
instrumental jams in the same fashion, both based on the Catalogue of Gigs,
Setlists & Tapes.



Catalogue of Gigs, Setlists & Tapes

"Pirate's Party, SS Bay Belle, NYC Harbor, 9/5/73":  90 SBD.  It's No Use,
Desilu, Leave Your Hat On, Mystery Train, The Harder They Come, Think,
Finders Keepers.  DB notes this date as a Saunders & Garcia gig but does not
give a setlist.  The date on this tape is certainly bogus.  The presence of
Desilu means it's probably no earlier than 11/74.

Keystone Berkeley 11/5/73:  per DB, no list.

Keystone Berkeley 1/17/74:  DB lists date as JGB, not LM.

Keystone Berkeley 1/18/74:  DB lists date as JGB, not LM.

Pauley Ballroom, UC Berkeley, 1/19/74:  60 SBD.  Think, Finders Keepers, The
Harder They Come, Feel Like Dynamite, Flute Thing #2, The Night They Drove
Old Dixie Down, How Sweet It Is.  This seems to be the complete set.  DB
lists date as JGB with Fierro as special guest.  

Great American Music Hall, SF 2/5/74:  180 SBD.  I:  Someday Baby, Flute
Thing #2, Roadrunner, It's Too Late, My Problems Got Problems, The Night
They Drove Old Dixie Down;  II:  The Harder They Come, Wonderin Why, Mystery
Train, My Funny Valentine, Are You Lonely For Me, How Sweet It Is.  DB has
Think opening the 2nd set, before Harder; the tape neither confirms nor
refutes this, but it seems less likely than the list as given.  DB lists
date as JGB, not LM.

Keystone Berkeley 2/7/74:    DB lists date as JGB, not LM.

Rheem Theater, Orinda 2/9/74:  90 SBD.  I:  Think, Finders Keepers, Are You
Lonely For Me, Second That Emotion, Wonderin Why, The Night They Drove Old
Dixie Down;  II:  The Harder They Come, Mystery Train, Flute Thing #2.
Clearly the 2nd set list is incomplete; its sequence may also be incorrect.
This 1st set confirms DB's; DB's 2nd set list runs:  < II:  Harder They
Come, Flute Thing #2, Roadrunner, Mystery Train >.    DB lists date as JGB,
not LM.

Keystone Berkeley 2/10/74:  per DB, which lists:  < Takes A Lot To Laugh,
Expressway, That's The Touch I Like, Jam, Imagine, That's Alright Mama,
Who's Loving You Tonight, Masterpiece, I Was Made To Love Her, Lonely
Avenue, Mystery Train >.  DB lists date but not as LM.  It's hard to know
what to make of the many unique features of DB's list for this date.
Besides Lonely Avenue, which appears only here and on one other DB list
(8/9/74), DB's list for 2/10/74 includes 4 tunes which occur only here
(Imagine, I Was Made To Love Her, Masterpiece, Who's Loving You Tonight).
This was only LM's seventh known gig; perhaps they were trying out material.
 Or perhaps the list is faulty.

Great American Music Hall, SF 2/12/74:  per DB, which lists:  < Hi-Heel
Sneakers, He Ain't Give You None, Second That Emotion, It's No Use,
Roadrunner, That's Alright Mama, It's Too Late, The Harder They Come >.  DB
lists date as JGB, not LM.

Keystone Berkeley 2/16/74:    DB lists date as JGB, not LM; no list.

Keystone Berkeley 2/17/74:  DB lists date as JGB, not LM; no list.

Great American Music Hall , SF 3/1/74:  DB lists date as JGB, not LM; no
list.

Keystone Berkeley 3/9/74:  DB lists date as JGB, not LM; no list.

Keystone Berkeley 3/14/74:  DB lists date as JGB, not LM; no list.

Chateau Liberte, Santa Cruz Mts 3/22/74:  DB lists date as JGB, not LM; no
list.

Great American Music Hall 5/2/74:  90 SBD & 90 AUD.  I:  It's Too Late, My
Problems Got Problems, The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down, Think, Someday
Baby, Flute Thing #2, Roadrunner;  II:  The Harder They Come, Wonderin Why,
Mystery Train, My Funny Valentine, Are You Lonely For Me, How Sweet It Is.
DB lists date as JGB, not LM.

[Great American Music Hall, SF 5/30/74.  DB lists as JGB, so this could be
LM, but more likely it's the Great American String Band.]

[Inn Of The Beginning, Cotati 5/31/74.  See note on 5/30/74.]

[Inn Of The Beginning, Cotati 6/1/74.  See note on 5/30/74.]

Lion's Share, San Anselmo 6/4/74:  135 SBD.  I:  Jam #1, Expressway, Second
That Emotion, Wonderin Why, Finders Keepers;  II:  Jam (All Blue), R&B
Medley w/ female vocalist, The Harder They Come, The Night They Drove Old
Dixie Down.  DB gives date & list but not as LM.

Lion's Share, San Anselmo 6/5/74:  45 SBD.  Flute Thing #2, Finders Keepers,
The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down, Kansas City w/ female vocalist.  DB
notes date but not as LM, no list.

Bottom Line, NYC 7/1/74, 7/2/74 & 7/3/74 are not LM (no Martin).

Keystone Berkeley 7/12/74:  90 SBD.  I:  Hi-Heel Sneakers, Expressway, He
Ain't Give You None, Wonderin Why, Second That Emotion;  II:  It's No Use,
Roadrunner ....  The tapes confirm DB thus far.  According to DB after
Roadrunner the 2nd set concludes with:  < That's Alright Mama, It's Too
Late, The Harder They Come, The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down >.

Keystone Berkeley 7/13/74:  90 SBD.  I:  Think, Finders Keepers, How Sweet
It Is, Someday Baby, Second That Emotion, Wonderin Why, The Night They Drove
Old Dixie Down;  II:  The Harder They Come.  Obviously the 2nd set is
incomplete.  DB has date but no list.

Great American Music Hall 7/14/74:  per DB, no list.

Keystone Berkeley 7/21/74:  per DB, which lists:  < The Harder They Come,
Jam, After Midnight, Jam, Leave Your Hat On, How Sweet It Is >.  This date
seems unlikely to be correct since the Dead played Hollywood on this day.
See also note on 8/31/74.

Keystone Berkeley 7/22/74:  per DB, which lists:  < Reggae Woman, Wonderin
Why, How Sweet It Is, Leave Your Hat On, That's What Love Will Make You Do,
Jam, The Harder They Come, Jam, How Sweet It Is >.

Great American Music Hall 7/23/74:  per DB, no list.

Great American Music Hall 8/7/74:  per DB, no list.

Keystone Berkeley 8/9/74:  per DB, which lists:  < Think, Expressway, Last
Train, Flute Thing #2, Second That Emotion, Mystery Train, Lonely Avenue >
How Sweet It Is >.

Keystone Berkeley 8/10/74:  per DB, which lists:  < I:  That's What Love
Will Make You Do, Flute Thing #2, It's No Use, Mystery Train, The Harder
They Come;  II:  It's Too Late, Roadrunner, The Night They Drove Old Dixie
Down >.

Keystone Berkeley 8/11/74:  per DB, which lists:  < I:  That's What Love
Will Make You Do, Flute Thing #2, It's No Use, Mystery Train;  II:  The
Harder They Come, Jam, It's Too Late, Roadrunner, The Night They Drove Old
Dixie Down >.

Great American Music Hall 8/14/74:  per DB, which lists:  < I:  Someday
Baby, Expressway, Wonderin Why, Jam, Roadrunnmer;  II:  Neighbor, Neighbor,
He Ain't Give You None, Jam, Mystery Train, Sittin In Limbo, How Sweet It Is
>.

Berkeley Community Theater 8/23/74:  per DB, no list.

Great American Music Hall 8/24/74:  per DB, no list.

Great American Music Hall 8/28/74:  per DB, no list.

Freeborn Hall, UC Davis 8/30/74:  100 SBD.  Harder They Come, My Funny
Valentine, Neighbor, Neighbor, He Ain't Give You None, Think, Flute Thing
#2, Mystery Train.  This is probably a complete set or show.

Keystone Berkeley 8/31/74:  90 SBD.  1st set conclusion:  The Harder They
Come;  II:  Jam #2, Jam #3, After Midnight, Jam #2, Leave Your Hat On, How
Sweet It Is.  This tape also circulates labeled "Keystone Berkeley 7/21/74"
& DB's list for 7/21/74 closely resembles this tape's list.  However,
7/21/74 can't be a correct date since the Dead play Hollywood on the same
day, and this tape is much more commonly circulated dated "8/31/74."  DB's
list for 8/31/74 runs <  I:  That's What Love Will Make You Do, My Funny
Valentine, Roadrunner, Wonderin Why, Tough Mama;  II:  Second That Emotion,
Jam, Jam, Mystery Train, Going Going Gone, How Sweet  It Is >.

Keystone Berkeley 9/1/74:  90 SBD.  Flute Thing #2, He Ain't Give You None,
Think, The Harder They Come, Neighbor Neighbor.  This list is obviously
partial and may be out of sequence.  DB gives date but no list.

Marx Meadow, Golden Gate Park, SF 9/2/74:  90 SBD.  Second That Emotion,
Expressway, Sittin In Limbo, Neighbor Neighbor, Flute Thing #2, Mystery
Train, How Sweet It Is.  This is probably the complete show.

Keystone Berkeley 10/3/74:  per DB, no list.

Keystone Berkeley 10/4/74:  per DB, which lists: < That's What Love Will
Make You Do, Jam, Roadrunner, It's No Use, Tough Mama, Jam, Sittin In Limbo,
Jam, How Sweet It Is >.

Keystone Berkeley 10/5/74:   per DB, which lists:  < I:  The Harder They
Come, Jam, He Ain't Give You None, Flute Thing #2, Mystery Train;  II:  Jam,
Neighbor Neighbor, Sittin In Limbo, Someday Baby, Second That Emotion >.

Great American Music Hall 10/6/74:  40 SBD.  Think, Bossa Martin > space jam
(A Love Supreme) (28:45).  DB gives date but no list.

Chateau Liberte, Santa Cruz Mts 10/11/74:  per DB, no list.

County Fairgrounds, Santa Barbara:  10/13/74:  per DB, no list.

Golden Bear, Huntington Beach 10/25/74:  per DB, no list.

Great American Music Hall 10/30/74:  per DB, no list.

Memorial Gym, USF, SF 10/31/74:  90 SBD.  I:  The Harder They Come,
Expressway, Leave Your Hat On, He Ain't Give You None, Freedom Jazz Dance,
Neighbor Neighbor, Mystery Train, Roadrunner, The Night They Drove Old Dixie
Down, How Sweet It Is.  This is probably the complete show.

Keystone Berkeley 11/1/74:  per DB, no list.

Keystone Berkeley 11/2/74:  per DB, no list.

Bottom Line, NYC 11/5/74:  90 AUD.  That's The Touch I Like, Desilu, He
Ain't Give You None, Leave Your Hat On, Second That Emotion, Flute Thing #2.
 The conclusion of this set is missing.  DB's < Jam > before Flute Thing #2
is probably erroneous.  After Flute Thing #2, DB concludes with < How Sweet
It Is, Mystery Train >.

Bottom Line, NYC 11/6/74:  per DB, which lists:  < Early Show:  Think, Jam,
Second That Emotion, Leave Your Hat On, Someday Baby, Mystery Train, The
Night They Drove Old Dixie Down;  Late Show:  Second That Emotion, Limbo,
Roadrunner >.

Bottom Line, NYC 11/7/74:  It's No Use, Desilu, The Harder They Come, Leave
Your Hat On, Takes Alot To Laugh, Mystery Train.

Greenvale, NY 11/"8"/74:  20 SBD.  It's No Use, Think.  Very likely this is
part of the same show as 11/18/74, whether the correct date of the whole is
11/8 or 11/18/74.

Capitol Theater, Passaic 11/9/74:  per DB, which lists:  < Early Show:
Mystery Train, The Weight, That's Alright Mama;  Late Show:  The Harder They
Come, Flute Thing #2, How Sweet It Is, He Ain't Give You None, The Night
They Drove Old Dixie Down >.

Palace Theater, Albany 11/10/74:  160 SBD.  I:  Let It Rock, Expressway,
Leave Your Hat On, Neighbor Neighbor, Going Going Gone, Mystery Train;  II:
Roadrunner, Desilu, Wonderin Why > Just Kissed My Baby, The Harder They
Come, Jam #6, Tough Mama, How Sweet It Is.

Paul's Mall, Boston 11/12/74:   per DB, which lists: < Suspicious Minds,
Wonderin Why, Flute Thing #2, Neighbor Neighbor >.

Paul's Mall, Boston 11/13/74:  90 AUD.  The Harder They Come, Desilu, Jam
#6, Someday Baby, Wonderin Why, Neighbor Neighbor, The Night They Drove Old
Dixie Down.  This could be the complete set or show but seems likelier to
have continued for another song.

Paul's Mall, Boston 11/14/74:  90 AUD.  Desilu, Let It Rock, My Problems Got
Problems, Mystery Train, My Funny Valentine > Just Kissed My Baby, Jam #6,
Bossa Martin.  This is incomplete and the sequence is probably disordered.
Cf. DB's list:  < Let It Rock, My Problems Got Problems, Mystery Train,
Think, Expressway, Going Going Gone, Blue Montreaux > Second That Emotion >.

Worcester Polytech, Worcester 11/15/74:  DB notes Early & Late Shows without
set lists.

Tower Theater, Upper Darby 11/16/74:  25 AUD.  That's The Touch I Like,
Expressway, He Ain't Give You None.  DB lists:  <  Early Show:  That's The
Touch I Like, Expressway, He Ain't Give You None, Leave Your Hat On, Desilu,
Going Going Gone, Second That Emotion;  Late Show:  Takes Alot To Laugh,
Jam, My Problems Got Problems, Mystery Train, Jam, The Harder They Come, The
Night They Drove Old Dixie Down >.

Greenvale, NY 11/18/74:  90 AUD.  How Sweet It Is, Finders Keepters, It's
Too Late, Leave Your Hat On, Sittin In Limbo, Mystery Train, Second That
Emotion.  This set is incomplete and the last 3 tunes are out of sequence.
Cf. 11/8/74 above (It's No Use, Think), which may well be part of this show,
and DB's note to 11/18/74:  < list uncertain - this may actually be 11/8/74
>.  DB's list matches the tapes' 1st 4 songs & concludes (perhaps correctly)
with < Sittin In Limbo, Mystery Train >.  Second That Emotion (and
11/"8"/74's It's No Use, Think?) must fall between (DB's list between Hat
and Limbo isn't much help:  < Going Going Gone, Jam, Second That Emotion,
Neighbor Neighbor, Flute Thing #2, Till The End Of The World, It's No Use
>).

Keystone Berkeley 11/27/74:  90 SBD.  I:  Bossa Martin, Leave Your Hat On,
Going Going Gone, Mystery Train;  II:  He Ain't Give You None, Freedom Jazz
Dance.  DB's list matches this and concludes with < Someday Baby, Second
That Emotion >.

Great American Music Hall 11/29/74:  180 SBD.  I:  It's No Use, Bossa
Martin, Leave Your Hat On, Mystery Train, Harder They Come;  II:  Going
Going Gone, Jam #6, Neighbor Neighbor, Wonderin Why, Just Kissed My Baby,
Second That Emotion.

Chateau Liberte, Santa Cruz Mts. 11/30/74:  per DB, no list.

Keystone Berkeley 12/6/74:  per DB, no list.

Keystone Berkeley 12/7/74:  90 AUD.  1st set conclusion:  The Night They
Drove Old Dixie Down;  II:  The Harder They Come, Think, Are You Lonely For
Me, How Sweet It Is, Second That Emotion, Roadrunner, It's Too Late ....
Obviously neither set is complete.  DB notes date but no list.

Boarding House, SF 12/12/74:    per DB, no list.

Boarding House, SF 12/13/74:    per DB, no list.

Great American Music Hall 12/15/74:  70 SBD.  Leave Your Hat On, Neighbor
Neighbor, The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down, It's No Use, Bossa Martin,
Second That Emotion.  Possibly a complete set, but probably missing an
opening tune.

Golden Bear, Huntington Beach 12/28/74:  90 AUD.  Think, Freedom Jazz Dance,
Boogie On Reggae Woman, Are You Lonely For Me, Neighbor Neighbor, The Harder
They Come.  Probably a complete set.

Golden Bear, Huntington Beach 12/29/74:  90 AUD.  I:  That's The Touch,
Desilu, Leave Your Hat On, Limbo, Second That Emotion.  The complete 1st
set.  DB's 2nd set runs:  <  II:  Mystery Train, Lala, Roadrunner, Going

Great American Music Hall 2/28/75:  70 AUD.  Second That Emotion, Leave Your
Hat On, Let It Rock; Flute Thing #2, Mississippi Moon, Going Going Gone.
Probably the conclusion of the set is missing.  DB notes date, no list.

Keystone Berkeley 3/2/75:  per DB, which lists < Last Train, Roadrunner >.

Pitchell Players Cabaret, Los Angeles 3/7/75:   per DB, which lists < That's

Bottom Line, NYC 4/10/75:  Both Shows 180 SBD.  Early Show:  Think, Finders

Corvalis, Talkin Bout You, Flute Thing #2, Boogie On Reggae Woman,
Mississippi Moon, Going Going Gone, Mystery Train.

Tower Theater, Upper Darby 4/11/75:  from Early 90 AUD, also 45 SBD; from
Late 20 SBD.  Early Show:  Tore Up, Desilu, Feel Like Dynamite, Last Train
To Corvalis, Tough Mama, Mystery Train, Second That Emotion, Expressway.
This tape confirms DB's list through Mystery Train; thereafter, DB gives <
Expressway, Flute Thing #2, Second That Emotion, The Night The Drove Old
Dixie Down >.  This seems too long to be likely but the tape does not rule
out the possibility.  From the Late Show there circulates tape only of I'll
Take A Melody and How Sweet It Is.  DB's Late Show list runs:  < The Harder
They Come, Leave Your Hart On, Philly Rag, Wicked Messenger, Money Honey,
Mississippi Moon, Boogie On Reggae Woman, I'll Take A Melody, Sittin In
Limbo, Tough Mama, How Sweet It Is >.

Masonic Temple, Scranton 4/12/75:  Early Show conclusion 90 SBD; Late Show
90 SBD.  Early Show conclusion:  Every Word You Say, That's What Love Will
Make You Do, Wicked Messenger, Tore Up, Tough Mama, Wonderin Why, I'll Take
A Melody, Talkin Bout You.  Late Show:  Let It Rock, Flute Thing #2, Boogie
On Reggae Woman, Mississippi Moon, Going Going Gone, Mystery Train.  Tapes
of 4/12/75 and 4/13/75 are confused in circulation and DB's lists reflect
this confusion.  The Late Show from 4/12/75 is in wide circulation labeled
"Washington, D.C. 4/13/75."  Some tapes of 4/12/75 circulate labeled "Tower
Theater, Upper Darby" and others circulate labeled "Philadelphia."

Washington, D.C. 4/13/75:  45 SBD.  DB's lists for these shows are obviously
incomplete, and the only "complete" tapes I've seen labeled with this date
turned out to be mostly 4/12/75, but there is one piece of tape in
circulation which is probably 4/13/75:  I'll Take A Melody, Mystery Train,
The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down.

Great Southeast Music Hall, Atlanta 4/15/75:  Late Show 90 SBD.  Early and
Late Shows per DB, no list for Early Show.  Late Show:  Tough Mama, Wonderin
Why, I'll Take A Melody, Think, Freedom Jazz Dance, Feel Like Dynamite,
That's What Love Will Make You Do, Mississippi Moon.  There was probably at
least one more song to conclude the set.  Tough Mama, Wonderin Why
circulates separately as fill, sometimes mislabeled "Chicago 4/18/75" or
"4/25/75" (no specified venue).

Great Southeast Music Hall, Atlanta 4/16/75:  Early and Late Shows per DB,
which lists:  < Early Show:  Neighbor Neighbor, Flute Thing #2, Feel Like
Dynamite, Second That Emotion, Money Honey, I'll Take A Melody, Expressway,
Roadrunner;  Late Show:  Let It Rock, Freedom Jazz Dance, The Harder They
Come, Wonderin Why, Every Word You Say, Boogie On Reggae Woman, How Sweet It
Is >.

Great Southeast Music Hall, Atlanta 4/17/75:  from Early Show 45 SBD; Late
Show 90 SBD.  DB lists for Early Show:  < Tore Up, Feel Like Dynamite, Going
Going Gone, That's What Love Will Make You Do, Desilu, He Ain't Give You
None, Mystery Train >; tape circulates of  Feel Like Dynamite, Going Going
Gone and Desilu.  Late Show:  I'll Take A Melody, You Can Leave Your Hat On,
Every Word You Say, Let It Rock, Boogie On Reggae Woman, Mississippi Moon,
Talkin Bout You, Roadrunner.

Chicago 4/18/75:  180 AUD: 1st set: Let It Rock, Flute Thing #2, Feel Like Dynamite,
Last Train From Corvalis, Tough Mama, Sittin In Limbo, Roadrunner; 2nd set: Tore Up,

Repertoire of Songs and Instrumental Jams


Songs

The date of every performance on circulating tape is listed, song by song.
Dates in < triangular > brackets are added from lists in DB & are
unsupported by tape in circulation (11/95).

Early and Late Shows are distinguished (4/9/75a, 4/9/75b) only when a song
appears in both.

Five songs which appear several times each in DB but nowhere on tape in
circulation (11/95) are nevertheless included here, since it seems plausible
that they figured in the repertoire, at least briefly (Lonely Avenue, Money
Honey, Takes Alot To Laugh, That's Alright Mama, When The Hunter Gets
Captured By the Game).  Two songs with a female vocalist performed once each
are listed separately at the conclusion, as are nine titles which appear
once each only in DB (and never on tape in circulation):  some may well have
been played; some may be reported in error; some are perhaps misnomers.

4/19/75.  DB confuses It's No Use and It's Too Late (e.g. 7/12/74); its
listings should be considered with added caution.

>.  DB's lists (e.g. 4.9.75b) may confuse this with Are You Lonely For Me
(as Last Train To Jacksonville); its listings should be considered with
added caution.

Songs Performed Once With A Female Vocalist

R&B Medley w/ female vocalist:  6/4/74 only

Kansas City w/ female vocalist:  6/5/74 only


Songs Reported In DB Once Only

Blue Montreaux:  < 11/14/74 > only.  Probably the name (erroneous or
correct) for a jam, but apparently none of the five instrumental jams that
occur on the tape in circulation.

Georgia On My Mind(Hoagy Carmichael & Steward Garrell):  < 5/12/75 > only.
Saunders & Garcia do this tune once or twice with Sara Fulcher in January
73; could she (or another female vocalist) be sitting in on this date?

Imagine (John Lennon):  < 2/10/74 > only.  One of several unique titles on
the DB list for this date (see note on the date in the Catalogue above);
Merl records Lennon's tune with Garcia on his Fantasy album, Heavy
Turbulence.

It Hurts So Bad:  < 6/3/75 > only.  Is this the Little Anthony tune or could
it be a misnomer for It's Too Late?

I Was Made To Love Her (Stevie Wonder):  < 2/10/75 > only.  Another unique
title on this date.

Masterpiece (Dylan):  < 2/10/74 > only.  Another unique title on this date,
Dylan's When I Paint My Masterpiece figured in the Garcia Band's repertoire
in the mid 70s.

Suspicious Minds:  < 11/12/74 > only.  Could this be Neighbor Neighbor?

Who's Loving You Tonight:  < 2/10/74 > only.  Another unique title on this
date.

The Weight (J.R. Robertson):  < 11/9/74 > only.  This tune was in NRPS'
repertoire when Jerry was a member in 69-71.



Instrumental Jams

This catalogue lists all Legion of Mary instrumental jams appearing on tape
in circulation (11/95).

Titles in "double quotation-marks" are current best guesses only.

Dates in < triangular > brackets are from DB only & are unsupported by tape
circulating (11/95).

Except for Expressway (To Your Heart), Finders Keepers, Flute Thing #2
(called "Lala") and Freedom Jazz Dance, these instrumentals generally appear
in DB (when they appear at all) simply as "Jam."

Because DB applies the names "Desilu," "Favella" and "System" to the same
jam (here called "Desilu") and also calls at least 2 different jams
