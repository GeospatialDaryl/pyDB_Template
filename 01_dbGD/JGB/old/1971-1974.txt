9/5/73 "Pirate's Party", SS Bay Belle, NYC Harbor, NY: 90 SBD.
It's No Use, Desilu, Leave Your Hat On, Mystery Train, The Harder They Come,

DB notes this date as a Saunders & Garcia gig but does not give a setlist.
The date on this tape is certainly bogus. The presence of Desilu means it's
probably no earlier than 11/74.

1/17/74 Keystone, Berkeley, CA: 60 SBD.
Finders Keepers, Think, Are You Lonely for Me, The Harder They Come.

This is most likely incomplete, but just what circulates.
DB has no setlist for this date, but show may be 1/17/73.

1/18/74 Keystone, Berkeley, CA
DB lists 1: < Someday Baby, Lala, Second That Emotion, Jam, Who's Loving You

Problems, The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down
2: < Think >, The Harder They Come, Wonderin Why, Mystery Train, My Funny
Valentine, Are You Lonely For Me, How Sweet It Is.
DB has Think opening the 2nd set, before Harder; the tape neither confirms
nor refutes this, but it seems less likely than the list as given.

2/7/74 Keystone, Berkeley, CA
No list in DB.

2/9/74 Rheem Theater, Orinda, CA: 90 SBD.
1: Think, Finders Keepers, Are You Lonely For Me, Second That Emotion,
Wonderin Why, The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down
2: The Harder They Come, Mystery Train, Flute Thing #2, Roadrunner, <
