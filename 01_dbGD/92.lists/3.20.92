All in all, a really solid, rocking show. Can't comment much on
the first set as I was behind the stage and the sound was excruciatingly
bad -- I think some of the PA wasn't working. The Same Thing, Bird Song
and The Promised Land were excellent, from what I could hear.

Moved for the second set. Dark Star and Drumz/Space were wonderful.
Especially Drumz/Space -- it was the highlight of the show for me. Parts
of it reminded me of Philip Glass or Steve Reich -- this was musicisnship
of the highest order. The Other One didn't push the envelope as much as
Hamilton '90 did. Standing on the Moon was nice, Lovelight I can take
or leave and US Blues was a powerhouse.

Now, for the tape grovel. I REALLY want a tape of this one. My wife
has pneumonia and was extremely p'd off at missing this show! Can
anyone help out? Leeave me E-Mail or reply via the newsgroup.

Do I wish I had tickets for tomorrow!
