Quick Review:
Liked it better than Monday, but not quite as much as last night.  Picasso moon was actually decent, and Deal was smokin'

Couldn't believe they played Corrina again...

Wave to the Wind really does sound like the Loveboat theme song..

Enjoyable show.... they played longer tonight. Started at 7:50, ended at 11:20
