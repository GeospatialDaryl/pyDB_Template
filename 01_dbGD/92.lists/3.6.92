 * the rest of the band messed around for about 5-10 minutes while
   Bobby fucked around with his equipment.  The crowd was *very*
    anxious to get the show started and Jerry said something to
    the audience, but I couldn't make it out.

    After FOTD (or was it Maggie's), Bob once again had some problem
    with his amp, and commented that they must have been hit by the
    Michaelangelo virus.

    Also, the arrow designations are accurate in the above list.  There
    was *no* transition from Corina into drums :( and Wharf Rat pretty
    much stopped before Sugar Mag.

    Let's see, I'll post a full review of both Hampton shows soon, but
    it seemed to me that the first set smoked, with each song except
    for, possibly, Stagger Lee and Picasso Moon a serious highlight.

    The second set highlights were the Truckin'>Crazy Fingers which
    had a great, if short, transition, also the Sugar Mag was
    incredible.

More later,
Vic
