SET I					SET II
Hell				China ->
Peggy-O				Rider
Walkin' Blues			Playin' ->
Ramble On Rose			Terrapin
Long Way From Home (new Vince)	Drums ->
Black Throated Wind 		Olin Arageed (with Hamza El-Din)
Morina (new Bobby)		Space ->
				Miracle
				Stella Blue
				Throw it Away
				E: Box of Rain

	All in all a pretty uninspired show.  First set was
dead until the new tunes.  The Vince number is a nice slow
simple one with a bluesy feel.  The hook was something like, 
"No matter where you're drawn to roam, its a long ... long way
home (lots of longs).  The Black Throated was with the
original lyrics.

	Morina was an interesting one.  A very short
phrase forms the basis with a typical lots-a-wierd-chords
Bobby break.  It seemed like something that would be good on
an album, but it has definately not found its live legs yet.
It has quite a bit of vocal harmonies.

	They boy's songwriting is not in dire shape.  I think
these tunes could work.
