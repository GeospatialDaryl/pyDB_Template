Do You Wanna Dance
Lyrics: Bobby Freeman
Music: Bobby Freeman

Only ever played once by the Dead, with the Neville Brothers as guests onstage
on 31 Dec 1987. But see below for a possible earlier involvement by Jerry
Garcia.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Do you wanna dance and hold my hand
Tell me I'm your loving man
Oh baby, do you wanna dance

Do you wanna dance and make romance
Squeeze me all through the night
Oh baby, do you wanna dance

Do you wanna dance under the moonlight
Squeeze me all through the night
Oh baby do you wanna dance

Do you wanna dance and hold my hand
Squeeze me and say I'm your man
Oh baby do you wanna dance

Do you wanna dance under the moonlight
Squeeze and kiss me all through the night
Oh baby do you wanna dance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Did Jerry Garcia play on the original recording?
According to some accounts, Jerry Garcia played guitar on the original Bobby
Freeman recording of "Do You Wanna Dance?"

The fullest account comes from David Nelson, quoted in Robert Greenfield's "Dark
Star: An Oral Biography of Jerry Garcia" (pp63-64):

"We all knew that he'd played electric guitar on Bobby Freeman's 'Do You Wanna
Dance.' Before any of this. Before the folk thing. When he was in high school.
In a real funky studio. If you listen to that recording, there are no drums.
There are cardboard boxes. He was a kid from Balboa High. It was what he used to
refer to as his 'teenage hoodlum period.' When he got that first electric guitar
from his mom in exchange for the accordion. He got that guitar and was really
happy with it and he told me that he just tuned it to one tuning. The solo
actually sounds like it could be in that tuning because he said it wasn't until
a couple of months later when he found out how to really tune it. It's very
primitive and it's very much that style of plunging out and jumping in with both
feet first. The solo itself is basically two licks used very modestly. Very
modestly."

And Sara Ruppenthal Garcia backs this up in the same book (p36):
"And in high school, Jerry had played on Bobby Freeman's 'Do You Wanna Dance.'
But he didn't consider that exactly worthy. What he really wanted to do was play
with Bill Monroe."

No mention of this is made in either Blair Jackson's "Garcia" An American Life"
or Dennis McNally's "A Long Strange Trip." Rock Scully, in "Living With The
Dead" says (p70):

"[Tom Donahue] has his own label, Autumn Records ... Garcia has done session
work for Autumn Records (including Bobby Freeman's single "Do You Wanna Dance?")
so Tom already knows him." What is odd about this story is the timing. Jerry
Garcia would have been 15 when "Do You Wanna Dance?" was recorded, and had been
playing the guitar for less than a year. The liner notes from a Bobby Freeman CD
give this account of how the song was recorded:

"Bobby decided to visit the disc jockey on his own, taking with him a
drum-playing friend ... Bobby accompanying himself on piano and his friend
beating out the rhythm on the congas demonstrated his wares on four numbers,
which the deejay took away with him. The vice president of Jubilee Records of
New York was honeymooning in San Francisco and combining business with pleasure
called in at the local radio station to see how his company's products were
faring. The deejay instead played him Bobby's tape, and Mortimer Pailitz liked
what he heard and within three weeks, Bobby was signed to Jubilee. They took the
original tapes that Bobby had cut in Frisco, overdubbed a guitar, bass and
drums, and released two of the tracks [including Do You Wanna Dance] on their
Josie subsidiary in March 1958."

David Nelson's comments square with Jerry Garcia having played on the recording
with his newly-acquired guitar, although I'm still not sure I believe that a
record company would use as a session musician a 15 year old school-kid who
barely knew how to play the guitar.

Some have speculated that Jerry Garcia knew Bobby Freeman when they were growing
up -- Freeman was only a couple of years older than Garcia. That's possible,
though I don't know of any evidence to support it.

It seems that Rock Scully is wrong when he says that Garcia's session work for
Autumn Records included "Do You Wanna Dance?" Tom Donahue and Bob Mitchell
founded Autumn Records in 1963, some five years after "Do You Wanna Dance?" was
recorded -- though it is true that some of Bobby Freeman's later recordings were
released by Autumn Records, and the Grateful Dead recorded some demos in their
very early days (under the name "The Emergency Crew"). See Matt Schofield's
discography for more information on Autumn Records.

we'd write and sometimes Jerry would sit there and draw.

Hunter tells me now that Jerry and I were the ones who were raving around at the
time, full of theatricality and spouting lines of poetry and being totally wild,
and he was more circumspect. I think his recollection is probably correct, but
what's interesting to me is that's not the person I later became."

SET2
COMMENTS -- (pg. 38-39*), In late spring of 1961, Marshall Leicester, who'd had
a passing friendship with Garcia back at Menlo Oaks Middle School, returned to
the Peninsula from a year at Yale. One day, "I walked into Kepler's and Jerry
was sitting there playing a twelve-string guitar and singing tunes like
'Everybody Loves Saturday Night' which was one of those kind of Pete Seeger
'love-your-worldwide-neighbors' songs in which the verses are the words
'everybody loves Saturday night' in about fifteen languages -- sort of the last
gasp of the politically oriented folk music of the '30s and '40s. I think I
asked to borrow his guitar and play some of my kind of music on it, and I think
we were mutually impressed with each other. We remembered having met before and
we hit it off."

Leicester taught Garcia the rudiments of the fingerpicking guitar style and also
introduced Garcia to the main traditional white folksong forms of the south --
old-time string band music and bluegrass. "He was playing more strum stuff,
Kingston Trio oriented songs," he notes. "He wasn't playing melodically oriented
guitar at all. I think he'd gotten away from rock 'n' roll too, so he wasn't
using a flat pick either. So I taught him how to play stuff like [Elizabeth
Cotten's] 'Freight Train', and he just took it and ran with it on his own -- I
never saw anybody learn how to do something as quickly as he picked up on that.
So from there he went and made himself into someone with a sense of style.

In those days we all wanted to be Mike Seeger, so we were all trying to learn to
play five or six instruments. I played guitar, banjo, autoharp and a little
mouth harp. I didn't become a fiddler, which is mostly what I am these days,
until a couple of years later. Jerry was just playing the guitar at first, but
then of course he took up the banjo and got really good at that, too."

By 1963 Jerry was trying his hand at mandolin, dobro, fiddle and autoharp as
well.

acapella. This set and the 01/??/62 Burlingame set also circulate together as
"Garcia, Hunter and Albin '62." It can be argued that the 'room ambience' and
recording quality of both tapes are identical; they -sound- like they were
recorded at the same time.

Blair Jackson ("Garcia, An American Life" -- pg. 39-40*), Early in the summer of
1961 a pair of folk music enthusiasts, Rodney Albin and George Howell, launched
a small coffeehouse called the Boar's Head in a loft above a bookstore called
the Carlos Bookstall in San Carlos (north of Menlo Park). Peter Albin, Rodney's
younger brother, later became a founding member of Big Brother and the Holding
Company.

As Dave Nelson says alongside Rodney Albin in Blair Jackson's ("Garcia, An
American Life" -- pg. 40*) book, referring to his 1st meeting with Garcia, "So
we asked him to come play at the Boar's Head. That night at the Boar's Head it
was Garcia, who played some songs on guitar, and then Bob Hunter came on wearing
his army boots, as he always did in those days, and he sang a couple of songs.
And there was also David X (David McQueen, a black man in his forties who was
part of the Chateau scene) and Sherry Huddleston, who's the one who gave Pigpen
his name (the next year). It was very low-key. The Boar's Head always seemed
more like a party than a real gig."

COMMENTS Jerry Garcia, Ron "Pigpen" McKernan, other personnel unknown * "Unident
Thing" * Other artists included: Mike Sector.

-- My reasoning for listing this separate (from 06/11/62):
I think the above is the same material you have listed (after Three Men Went
A-Hunting) on 06/11/62. And indeed, this follows Three Men W.A.H. on one of my
copies of 6/11/62... but it's listed separately as "Unident Thing w/ Pig &
Jerry"...
that's it -- no date, location, venue. Specific reasons (in no particular
order):
* it's listed on my tape separately
* there is a splice and a marked difference in sound quality and tone
* Pigpen only appears on *this* portion / other personnel have changed
* Sandy Troy's 'Early Garcia Song List' ("Captain Trips," Appendix A) seems to
agree (that the 6/11/62 set ends with Three Men W.A.H.).

-- My reasoning for listing two sets:
* After Goin' To Chicago, Mike Sector introduces himself (apparently as a guest
act, between sets): "I don't think many of you know me, but I'm a guest here
tonight.

My name is Mike Sector and..."(cut).

Then cuts into crowd silence>applause> Garcia: "Uh, I'm back again, but this
time it's purely secondary, uh... a lot of... perhaps those of you that heard,
uh...
Ron play the harmonica, were impressed by his playing... playing, but there is
another side to this... even more impressive, I think.... So, even though he'd
be the last to admit it... I'd better shut up."

-- Note: And I'm not extremely convinced 'Blue Goose' belongs with this list.
It, too, has a slightly different sound quality and tone. Does that sound like
Garcia's guitar-playing to you?

these tapes (02/23/63, 05/04/63 [Jerry & Sarah] and ??/??/63 [Second Story Men])
came into circulation:

-- [Before 05/04/63 Jerry & Sarah:]
DJ: (cut) "...primo sounding. How did you get such good tape?"
RR: "Well, these are courtesy of, uh, Dr. Stu Goldstein (a fellow physician in,
uh, Walnut Creek) wco-manager of the Tangent back in, uh, 1963. Yeah."
DJ: "Wow! That's really cool."
RR: "So tonight we're gonna hear, uh, first Jerry and Sarah Garcia. Deep Elem
Blues, uh, Will Of The Weaver, I Truly Understand, All The Good Times Are Past
And Gone, Long Black Veil, Man Who Wrote 'The Home Sweet Home' Never Was A
Married Man, Keno The Rent Man, and finally, If I Was On A Foggy... oh, Some
Foggy Mountain Top. Here we go."
DJ: "Alright, here we go, on the KFOG Deadhead Hour."

-- [After 05/04/63, before 02/23/63:]
DJ: "Wow! This is the KFOG Deadhead Hour. And Richard, that was incredible."
RR: "Yeah... it's not the KFOG, uh, Hayseed Hour. I know it sounds that way, but
this is, uh... some early stuff from 1963, from uh... the early portion of that
year, from the Tangent, in Palo Alto. And that was, uh, Jerry and Sarah
Garcia -- right down to announcing their nuptials. That was... that
was pretty interesting."
DJ: "Yeah."
RR: "Well, let's, uh, keep going here. This is the Wildwood Boys. And I do have
a date, a precise date on this one. How about that? Two, twenty-three,
sixty-three (2/23/63). Again, at the Tangent, uh... and they are: Jerry Garcia,
Robert Hunter, David Nelson and, uh, Norm Van Mastrict. And, uh, here's a bunch
of stuff: Rollin' In My Sweet Baby's Arms, Jerry's Breakdown, Standin' In The
Need Of Prayer, Muleskinner Blues, then a solo number by Norm, and, uh, Pike
County Breakdown, Come All Ye Fair And Tender Maidens and We Shall Not Be
Moved -- right here on the KFOG Deadheads Hour."

-- [After 02/23/63, before Second Story Men:]
DJ: "You're listening to the KFOG Deadhead Hour. With us tonight, Richard
Raphel(sp?) who is responsible for giving us all these, uh... these great tapes.
Hi Richard."
RR: "Well it's a pleasure to 'em all. Yeah."
DJ: "Oh... boy. I'm really diggin' this stuff."
RR: "Well, that was the, uh, Wildwood Boys: Jerry Garcia, Bob Hunter, uh, Dave
Nelson and, uh, Norm Van Mastrict. And we're gonna continue now with, uh, just a
couple of tunes from the Second Story Men which was, uh, Pigpen's group around
the same time. This is also recorded at the Tangent... in Palo Alto. And we just
have time for two quick ones... uh, McKernan's Blues and the Rocky Mountain
Blues -- here on the KFOG Deadhead Hour."

-- Matt Schofield:
I'd suggest a couple of name changes to this.
---------------------------------------------
Rollin' In My Sweet Baby's Arms - This most commonly occurs as: Roll In My Sweet
Baby's Arms. That's the name we've gone with for the Dead's version.
---------------------------------------------
Muleskinner Blues - Although it does often occurs as above, it was originally
recorded as: Mule Skinner Blues.
---------------------------------------------
We Shall Not Be Moved - This title was adapted when the song was adopted by
protest movements in the 30's. Before that, the song was known only as: I Shall
Not Be Moved. Although Jerry sings 'We shall not be moved' in the chorus, the
verses are similar to the gospel original rather than the 30s version.

-- Matt Schofield:
'Keno The Rent Man' recorded by the New Lost City Ramblers as 'Keno The Rent
Man' and I think is in their song book.

Mike Seeger recorded a version of 'Will The Weaver" in the early 60s which is
similar to Jerry's version. 'Will The Weaver' mutated into a song called
'Everyday Dirt' but, from the few examples I've heard/seen, the song Jerry does
is closer to the original 'Will The Weaver'.

There's some quotes from Sara in Robert Greenfield's 'Dark Star" - An Oral
Biography Of Jerry Garcia;

  "Valiantly, Jer also tried to learn the fiddle when she [Heather] was a baby.
   That was painful to be around. But she's a violinist now."

And also;

  "We sang together and I played a little autoharp and my little rosewood Martin
guitar.
   He played most of the instruments."

-- On one of the circulating recordings provided by Jeff Tiedrich & redigitized
by Teddy GoodBear:
This has been speed & pitch corrected. BTW, I now think it's more likely this is
all from a 2nd set, since there seems to be no splice before "Long Black Vail" &
"Deep Elem" cuts in.

Eric Thompson took up the guitar as a teenager in Palo Alto, California in the
early 1960's, at a time when very few folk guitarists were playing more than
basic rhythm guitar. Among his earliest bands were the Black Mountain Boys (with
Jerry Garcia and David Nelson) and Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions. He
quickly became nationally known as an exceptional lead flatpicker, winning the
World Championship Cup at Union Grove, North Carolina with the New York Ramblers
(which also included David Grisman and Winnie Winston) and flying to Nashville,
Tennessee to record Beatle Country with the Charles River Valley Boys (reissued
on Rounder).

COMMENTS Black Mountain Boys: Jerry Garcia, banjo and guitar; David Nelson,
mandolin; Sandy Rothman, guitar, Robert Hunter, bass player.

-- My reasoning for listing Sandy Rothman as guitarist and Robert Hunter as
bassist:

* Before Homestead On The Farm, someone (Robert Hunter?) says: "We're gonna do a
song called Homestead on the Farm. Or, Sandy's gonna sing a song."
* Before Two Little Boys, someone (Hunter?) says: "Uh, while Sandy tunes his
guitar... The next song is gonna be Two Little Boys... or the name of the next
song is gonna be Two Little Boys. The name of the next song *is* Two Little
Boys, in fact."
* Before Rosalie McFall, Garcia says: "Sandy gets to play... uh, play a lot of
stuff on this one here."
* Before Love Please Come HomeSo Sandy went and foolishly put new strings on his
guitar last month..."
* Sandy Troy lists the following personnel ("Captain Trips," Appendix A):
Garcia, banjo; David Nelson, mandolin; Robert Hunter, bass; Sandy Rothman,
guitar.

-- My reasoning for listing as SET2 and SET3 (and not SET1):

* Before Sawood Mountain, Garcia mentions: "We figured we'd just stand around
this set, you know. . . we played last set" (... so I'm assuming there was
another set before this - SET1.)
* My tape ends (cuts) during John Hardy with Garcia(?) saying: "Thank you very
much for, uh... bearing with us, coming to see us, and... we'll be back in about
20 minut..."(cut) IMO, this is definitely a set break -- but between which two
sets? I'm missing the Roll On Buddy->Black Mtn. Rag, so I can't tell where this
might belong (but Sandy Troy lists it after Make Me A Pallet On Your Floor - and
does not list the John Hardy at all). BTW, there is *not* a cut/splice between
Make Me A Pallet and John Hardy on my tape.

RECORDINGS 40+ A?. Audience recording, possibly from mics placed on stage.

COMMENTS As of 3/99: Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions (GDCD 4064)

Grateful Dead Records is delighted to call your attention to the recorded debut
(a mere thirty-five years late) of Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions.

Yep, you read right! What we have here amounts to the Rosetta Stone of Grateful
Dead tape archaeology - a complete July, 1964 performance by the ragtag little
jug band that, despite its fairly short life span, served a rather large
function in musical history, as it represented the very first collaboration
between future members of the Dead (Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir and Pigpen).

Almost no one knew these tapes even existed, and those who did feared that they
might be lost. Some collectors had a couple of songs from this performance on
tape, from a 1969 radio documentary, but that was it.

Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions ("McCree" being just one of the many
different ways the band spelled its name - out of sheer prankishness, they
spelled it differently at every gig) was formed in early 1964 in Palo Alto,
California in the midst of the Great Folk Revival. The band played for most of
its brief lifespan at coffee houses and clubs frequented by members of the
Stanford University community. Less than a year the jug band had evolved into an
electric blues band called The Warlocks, which in turn changed its name to
Grateful Dead, and you know the rest of that story!

One of the jug band's shows at a popular local spot was featured on an
installment of Live at the Top of the Tangent, a program on the Stanford radio
station KZSU, hosted and produced by an undergraduate named Pete Wanger. Some
five years later, after the Grateful Dead had become something of a household
name in the San Francisco rock scene, Pete's brother Michael included two songs
from that live Tangent broadcast on a documentary about the Dead, broadcast on
the trailblazing San Francisco station KSAN. And that, it was thought, was the
last we'd ever hear of Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions.

But Michael Wanger was a man with a mission. He knew that there was more of this
music out there, and he wanted to find it. Wanger remembers that "I badgered my
brother about the tapes but he could not remember what he'd done with them. In
1994 or '95, Vance, my partner on the Grateful Dead documentary,
found a partial tape (containing ten songs) in his garage. It was the master
that I was after." In 1997, fate intervened: "After our mother passed away,"
Michael recalls, "Peter and I were clearing things out of her house, and stashed
away in the attic was a box containing all of the 'Top of the Tangent' tapes.
Sure enough, the Mother McCree's stuff was there, in excellent condition* and
with songs that weren't on any of the other tapes I'd found."

In fact, Wanger wound up with 16 songs, and the long-lost Mother McCree's Uptown
Jug Champions album became a reality at last, with an assist from the digital
mastering and editing ninjas of Club Front.

And the results are quite delightful - the performance is the very epitome of
the expression "ragged but right," and the overall feeling of goofy joy in the
music is quite irresistible.  You can definitely hear the ancestral roots of the
Grateful Dead here - several of the songs ("Ain't It Crazy," "Beat It On
Down The Line," "On The Road Again" and "The Monkey and the Engineer") found
their way into the Dead's rotation, as did other tunes from the jug band days
("Viola Lee Blues," "New Minglewood Blues") that were not played that night at
the Tangent.

"Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions" is, of course, an absolute must for any
serious scholar of Grateful Dead music. But you don't have to be all that
serious to enjoy it. Bob Weir says it all when he sums up the jug band's
original intent: "We just set out to have one hell of a good time. And we did."

Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions is available by Mail Order Only from
Grateful Dead Merchandising (1-800-CAL-DEAD). The price is $12.00 (plus shipping
and handling - California residents add 7.25% sales tax).

Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions borrowed heavally from the Jim Kweskin
Band, 'borrowed?, you mean stoled'!

Talks about blues influences ("Mr. Pig Pen") that lead to playing electric.

The Rub.- summer '64? (noted by Michael Wanger in email to Teddy GoodBear)

Bob Weir: Goes on to talk about Pigpen:
After being a jug band for over a year Jerry & Bob go on to talk about playing
electric, "...to play louder...".

They picked up 2 more local musicians:
Dan Morgan Jr. - bass
Bill Sommers - who taught drums at the store

The Warlocks were formed. They became weird when they started working in bars.
Phil Lesh replaces Dana during the bar room days.
